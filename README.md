This is a small, cheap but effective 10-second sound recording module, ideal for connecting to a ÂµController to issue a simple announcement, warning or information statement.

Here I show how to connect it up to both the Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Nano - simple in the extreme! 

In case you find your own voice a little boring, I also demonstrate how to capture sound from a text-to-speech reader.
